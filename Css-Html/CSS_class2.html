      When was the last time India used nine bowling options? Well it was their
      first ever in World Cup history. Making the most of their inconsequential
      league game against Netherlands on Sunday at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in
      Bengaluru, India did a bit of a bowling experiment as they tested their
      part-time options which included Virat Kohli and captain Rohit Sharma
      himself. The skipper later revealed that it was all according to their
      pre-match plan of testing their options for a sixth bowler as India
