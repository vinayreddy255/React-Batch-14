      "hile the world is raging over Travis Head and what a majestic century he struck in the final against India to give Australia a sixth World Cup title, Marnus Labuschagne played an equally crucial innings. The partnership of Head and Labuschagne, which yielded 191 runs, sealed the game for Australia after they found themselves in trouble at 47/3 in a chase of 240. With a third wicket going down with Jasprit Bumrah getting Steve Smith out LBW in a shocker, the Indians sensed a big opening and welcomed Labuschagne to the wicket with all sorts of hostility.";
